                <h1>About UFLC</h1>
                <p class="subhead">On 1st July, 2018 students from various colleges across Pune came together to form UFLC. It evolved to be a common platform for youth ignited with social responsibility. We adopted a democratic setup for organization so that ever capable and committed person gets to play a vital role through UFLC. We have conducted more than 25 social events and projects within a span of 15 months either individually or through collaborations. UFLC is open to all kinds of collaborations for social benefit. We have also worked together with various colleges across Pune. Currently we are active in various spheres of work through field work, awareness and campaigns. UFLC is open for new ideas & projects and is determined in driving this movement to a larger scale. </p>
